Coding languages are very precise, logical, and often require great attention to detail1.Kids can start learning basic programming as early as 5 years old, and sometimes even younger. Even before they can read, kids can engage in image-based games and puzzles that present coding principles. Older students can jump in at any time, beginning with simple languages or advancing to more complex ideas.</h2>
